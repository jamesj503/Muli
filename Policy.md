# Security Policy

## Supported Versions

Versions 5 (A & B), 7 (A), 8 (A & B) + are supported on our security policy. Anything below that, it is your responsibility to maintain your safety online. Since you are using 3rd party (me) code, it is your fault if you are reported on ANY website (Skyward or Canvas) and you get in trouble for it. Schools are supposed to maintain our safety and editing Canvas and Skyward can get you in trouble due to the sensitive material it has on it. Be careful how you use this code. (If you fail a test or an exam due to this extension, I cannot be at fault.) Since this changes the appearance of the website, if you miss an assignment or test (or anything really) I am not in fault, it is your responsibility to make sure you do what you are supposed to.

## Reporting a Vulnerability
<br>
If you find an issue that can comprimise our safety online with any of my code (on any repo) email me immediately. Thanks!
If you get reported for using this, I will immediately disable this for everyone (once the desktop app is released.) have fun and stay safe!
