## Welcome to Muli 👋

This will soon be the Muli webpage. We are currently keeping it under construction, but hopefully, it will be here soon! For now, you can see the official releases of Muli [here✨](https://github.com/jamesj503/Muli/releases/tag/Rel18%3BMuliV12-7). If you are worried about downloading an unstable (new) version, download the newest certified stable version [here✨](https://github.com/jamesj503/Muli/releases/tag/v27)

### CSS is a major part in Muli 👨‍💻

CSS is a styling code language where you can change the look of the website. That's all. Please star the repo, since it took a long time to make! What you are seeing below is part of our Canvas remodeling. This came from (I could be wrong) our Calander patch where we corrected the backdrop/shadows on the boxes and the colors.

```markdown
div.fOyUs_bGBk.fOyUs_dBtH {
  text-transform: lowercase;
  background-color: #FFFFFF;
  color: #000000;
}

label.bgKsu_blJt {
  text-transform: lowercase;
  text-align: right;
}

span.fCrpb_bGBk.fCrpb_egrg {
  text-align: right;
}

div.enRcg_bGBk.enRcg_cMDj.enRcg_pEgL.enRcg_eQnG {
  font-weight: 300;
  font-style: normal;
  text-decoration: underline;
  text-transform: lowercase;
  text-align: right;
}
```
