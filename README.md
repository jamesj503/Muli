## Welcome to Muli 👋

This will soon be the Muli webpage. We are currently keeping it under construction, but hopefully, it will be here soon! For now, you can download Muli [here✨](https://github.com/jamesj503/Muli/releases/tag/Rel18%3BMuliV12-7). If the build is failing, that doesn't mean it isn't working, that just means the code isn't up to the latest standard with jruby.

### CSS is a major part in Muli 👨‍💻
<br>
CSS is a styling code language where you can change the look of the website. That's all. Please star the repo, since it took a long time to make!

```markdown
div.fOyUs_bGBk.fOyUs_dBtH {
  text-transform: lowercase;
  background-color: #FFFFFF;
  color: #000000;
}

label.bgKsu_blJt {
  text-transform: lowercase;
  text-align: right;
}

span.fCrpb_bGBk.fCrpb_egrg {
  text-align: right;
}

div.enRcg_bGBk.enRcg_cMDj.enRcg_pEgL.enRcg_eQnG {
  font-weight: 300;
  font-style: normal;
  text-decoration: underline;
  text-transform: lowercase;
  text-align: right;
}
```
