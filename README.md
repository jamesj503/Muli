*we update Muli twice a day if needed.*
# Welcome to Muli
<br>

This is the new [Muli.](https://github.com/jamesj503/Muli/releases) I think you will love this new update because so much has changed!
<br>

# What has Changed in the V11-6 Update?
<br>

I have tried my best to work on the exam pages. They look cleaner now, the blue buttons are no longer there. Pull an issue if you find any, send the link, and screenshot! Thanks! Please consider "starring" this repo for announcements on further changes.
<br>

# What is coming up?
<br>

We are excited to announce the upcoming [Chrome Extension](https://free.timeanddate.com/countdown/i7rsdv5e/n5704/cf12/cm0/cu4/ct0/cs0/ca0/co1/cr0/ss0/cac000/cpc000/pcfff/tcfff/fs100/szw320/szh135/tatTime%20until%20Desktop%20App%20Release!/tac000/tptTime%20since%20Event%20started%20in/tpc000/iso2021-05-31T00:00:00), which will allow the code to be injected to the website without a 3rd party Chrome Extension! (This will be free)
<br>

# Download Instructions
<br>

Download the [latest release](https://github.com/jamesj503/Muli/releases) and save it to a convenient folder. If you are inexperienced on Github, download the file with the yellow underline in the image below (it will say .json on it)

Next, download [this](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/user-javascript-and-css/nbhcbdghjpllgmfilhnhkllmkecfmpld) Chrome extension, it has to be this one because it's just an export file from the extension. After it installs, open it and press the cog icon on the top right of the pop-up. It will open up the "[User JavaScript and CSS](extension://nbhcbdghjpllgmfilhnhkllmkecfmpld/options.html)" page. Next, go to the fourth tab named "Settings". Next, scroll down to the backup tab. It should look like this:

Press the "upload and apply" button. This will open up your "file explorer" page. Locate the file you downloaded from my Github repo and select that. A popup arning you that it will override data will come up. Press "ok" and it should now work! 
<br>

# Troubleshooting
<br>

Sliders: This is the most common issue, you need to make sure both of the sliders are turned on. Let me show you how. <br>
  -Open the extension. <br>
  -Press the cog button. <br>
  -Make sure you are on the "Sites" tab <br>

  -Make sure both the sliders are on (green) to turn Muli on!
  <br>
Wrong/Outdated Version: This is another common mistake. You may not have the correct version downloaded. I no longer update my main tree:

So if you got the code from there, it won't work because it is outdated. Go to the newest release and follow the [download instructions](https://github.com/jamesj503/Muli#download-instructions) and it should work. If you have an issue that isn't covered here, open an issue [here.](https://github.com/jamesj503/Muli/issues)<br>
Thank you for using me! Have a nice day!
