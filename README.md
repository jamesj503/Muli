# Muli - A Canvas by Instructure CSS Element

A website theme for Canvas by Instructure. Many schools use it, especially during COVID, and I thought it would be cool if I would make the layout and the overview less overwhelming!<br>
My name is James Johnston. I love making websites my own by turning them into something I can personally say I made. Even though, no, I did not make Canvas, I like making it look less overwhelming and making it more user friendly. So say goodbye to harsh colors, harsh CAPS LOCK (on the "missing" badges) and say hello to Muli, The new style.<br>
<br>
Using this is incredibly simple. It uses a Chrome extension to run the CSS and Ruff coding to make this website look cleaner. You can take a look at the Chrome extension and the reviews to make sure it is safe (which it is) and the code I make is never used to harvest your information. How can you be sure? CSS is a coding language that ONLY controls the part of the website you can view (like the dashboard and the modules) but never the code you can't. Because of this, the only code being executed will be changing colors and fonts.
<br>

<br>
Here is a quick preview of the dashboard:

^the colors are not editable for now, you can always manipulate the code, but I suggest you don't unless you know what you are doing. I will make more color styles! For now, this is it. <br>
**Some elements seen in this image are only in the V7BETA for now, soon enough they will be available.**

Here is a quick preview of a teacher/class page (all will have the same features):

# Download Instructions:
<br>
<br>
I reccommend using <a href="https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/user-javascript-and-css/nbhcbdghjpllgmfilhnhkllmkecfmpld">this Chrome extension.</a> However, you can use any CSS or JS tool you want to (preferably a CSS tool since this is written in CSS, just to avoid issues). I find that this one works the best. (I use it to test my code!)
<br>
<br>
After installing, all you need to do is copy my code from <a href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/jamesj503/Muli/main/Muli.V5">the Github raw file,</a> over to the right-hand-side of the editor on the extension. After that, go up to the URL editor in the top middle and change it to https://canvas.allenisd.org/ and it will work on ALL canvas.allenisd pages (including your modules, grades, and teacher pages.)
<br>
<br>
Before you press save, make sure:
The URL is correct; the CSS code is on right side, not left; and don't forget to press save (top right corner)!
<br>
<br>
# Please see:
For those intelligent people who can inject CSS files to a webpage without an extension, go to my latest release and download the .css file!
