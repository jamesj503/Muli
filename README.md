# Download Instructions

<br>
New Download instructions are needed for the Direct Inject. First, download the newest release. Then open the chrome extension (this download only works with (https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/user-javascript-and-css/nbhcbdghjpllgmfilhnhkllmkecfmpld) this chrome extension) then go to the settings. Scroll over to the "settings" tab and scroll down to "Backup." Press "Upload and Apply". Find the file you just downloaded (it will be .json) and press ok. Then, a popup at the top of the screen will come up, press ok. (all it says it you will override your current update with the new one basically). Enjoy the new update!

# What is Muli and MuliSky?
Muli and MuliSky are website themes for Canvas by Instructure and Skyward. Many schools use it, especially during COVID, and I thought it would be cool if I would make the layout and the overview less overwhelming!<br>
My name is James Johnston. I love making websites my own by turning them into something I can personally say I made. Even though, no, I did not make Canvas, I like making it look less overwhelming and making it more user friendly. So say goodbye to harsh colors, harsh CAPS LOCK (on the "missing" badges) and say hello to Muli, The new style.<br>
<br>
Using this is incredibly simple. It uses a Chrome extension to run the CSS and Ruff coding to make this website look cleaner. You can take a look at the Chrome extension and the reviews to make sure it is safe (which it is) and the code I make is never used to harvest your information. How can you be sure? CSS is a coding language that ONLY controls the part of the website you can view (like the dashboard and the modules) but never the code you can't. Because of this, the only code being executed will be changing colors and fonts.
<br>
<br>
<br>
Here is a quick preview of the dashboard:

^the colors are not editable for now, you can always manipulate the code, but I suggest you don't unless you know what you are doing. I will make more color styles! For now, this is it. <br>
**Some elements seen in this image are only in the V7BETA for now, soon enough they will be available.**

Here is a quick preview of a teacher/class page (all will have the same features):

# What is coming up?
Unjailbroken devices must install Chrome on their device to have this work. Follow the same steps as a computer! If you do not know what a jailbroken device is, this does not effect you!<br>
**JAILBROKEN DEVICES ARE IN BETA V's CURRENTLY. SUBJECT TO CHANGE DEPENDING ON WHETHER I CAN FIX ISSUES OR NOT. CURRENT FURTHER DEV. FOR THIS IS ON HOLD. HOWEVER THERE IS A CYDIA REPO THAT WILL HELP YOU USE THIS IF YOU NEED**
<br>
A new version of Muli will also control your Skyward page, for the first time ever!

# Why start on V5?
<br>
We didn't. Check out our original styles in our old repo!(https://github.com/jamesj503/archive) It includes more styles (that will not be updated as of right now.)
