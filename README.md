*we update Muli twice a day if needed.*
# Welcome to Muli
<br>

This is the new [Muli.](https://github.com/jamesj503/Muli/releases) I think you will love this new update because so much has changed!
<br>

# What has Changed in the V12-6 Update?
<br>

I have tried my best to work on the exam pages. They look cleaner now, the blue buttons are no longer there. Pull an issue if you find any, send the link, and screenshot! Thanks! Please consider "starring" this repo for announcements on further changes.
<br>

# What is coming up?
<br>

Our Chrome extension has been released. You will see it in a full release soon. This means you no longer have to mess around with any other extensions. (this also works on Microsoft Edge and any other chromium based browser.)
Firefox users will be able to use our code for the first time soon! All we need to do is change some of the code! Soon, it will be ready!<br>

# Troubleshooting
<br>

Sliders: This is the most common issue, you need to make sure both of the sliders are turned on. Let me show you how. <br>
  -Open the extension. <br>
  -Press the cog button. <br>
  -Make sure you are on the "Sites" tab <br>

  -Make sure both the sliders are on (green) to turn Muli on!
  <br>
Wrong/Outdated Version: This is another common mistake. You may not have the correct version downloaded. I no longer update my main tree:

So if you got the code from there, it won't work because it is outdated. Go to the newest release and follow the [download instructions](https://github.com/jamesj503/Muli#download-instructions) and it should work. If you have an issue that isn't covered here, open an issue [here.](https://github.com/jamesj503/Muli/issues)<br>
Thank you for using me! Have a nice day!
